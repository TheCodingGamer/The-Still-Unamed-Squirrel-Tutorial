#Chapter 1. Gentlemen, start your editors!
Welcome to the world of Squirrel. We have nuts.

If you haven't already, you're going to need to [download Squirrel](http://squirrel-lang.org/#download). The current release is 3.0.x. Unfortunately, there's no official pre-built* distributions, so you'll have to compile it yourself (aw man!)

<sup>* If you're using Linux, double check to see if your distro offers a package. Of course, building from source is probably more up to date anyways.</sup>

If you open the tarball you download, it will have some Makefiles, and a Visual Studio project file. Either way, you're going to need a C++ compiler. I assume you know how to compile these, so go ahead and do it now.

Once your done, you'll see you should have three things built. Under the `lib` folder you'll have two libraries. One is Squirrel, and the other is Squirrel's standard library. The first is used for embedding Squirrel into your own C/C++ programs, and the second for giving some utilities to the programs you've embedded. For now, we won't be using these, but it's good to know that they're there.

The last thing, and the one we actually care about, is in the `bin` folder. It's an executable called `sq`. This is a stand-alone Squirrel interpreter, and can run your scripts for testing, debugging, or whatever reasons you may have.

Unfortunately, again, Squirrel has no default installation method, so you'll have to manually copy this to a place where you can call it from the command-line, or modify your path variables.

Once that's done, you can run scripts by running it as:

    sq myfile.sq

_Note: The official file extensions for Squirrel files is `.nut` and `.cnut` (for precompiled scripts.) That said, any file name can be supplied and it will load that file, and so, most projects roll their own extension. I personally prefer the `.sq` and `.sqc` extensions. Just use whatever floats your boat._

##Well hello there...
And now, the moment you've all been waiting for: _Hello World in Squirrel!_ If you haven't been waiting for this moment, then the least you could do is thank me tomorrow morning when you wake up and realize the universe is still here...

Fire up your favorite editor, and type this in:

    // Example 1.1
    print("Salve, terra\n")

Oh, that? Well, y'see the thing is that I think Latin is much cooler than English (like so cool we should ditch the king's favorite language altogether. Too much? Probably.) Regardless of the language, if all went well you'll have greeted that good Earth if you ran this program.

Now let's over analyze this bad boy.

First off, the first line is a comment. Squirrel has two types of comments: single and multi-line. A single line comment begins with either a `//` or a `#` and runs until the end of the line. A multi-line comment begins with `/*` and runs until a `*/` is found, regardless of newlines, whitespace, etc. Also, multi-line comments can't be nested, so be careful when commenting out other code that already uses them.

Next up is a function call. We'll cover all of Squirrel's function capabilities in depth later, but for now I assume all of you are more or less comfortable with this. One thing about `print` is that it doesn't add a `\n` character to the text it prints by default, like Lua. I find this extremely annoying since when a script ends, my command prompt won't be on it's own line, but rather smack dab against my output. For now, just live with it by adding `\n`s. A little bit later we'll take a look at a hackish solution.

##A global and `local` situation
Like most decent programming languages, Squirrel has variables. On top of that, they can not only be updated (this ain't Haskell, y'know!), they're also typeless. If that last bit threw you off, perhaps it would be better if I say it like this: Squirrel variables don't have any type themselves, but rather hold values that have types. Basically they're like a box that can hold different types of data. Nifty.

Now, like most programming languages, Squirrel has _scope_, and this mainly affects its variables. In other words, you can define where a variable is visible, or can be used.

We'll start out really broadly, with _global variables_. A global variable is available to everyone, everywhere. Think of it like Christmas. Everybody who's not a Scrooge knows about it, and can take part in it. In other words, 'tis the variables to be jolly.

Now, a global variable is created by using the `<-` operator. You can update variables with the `=` operator. One cool thing about the `<-` operator though, is that if a variable is already declared, it will update it instead, just like `=`. In general, if a variable is global, it's best just to use `<-` for everything. In my humble opinion, this make your program easier to read, but yeah, sure, whatever.

Let's look at this example: 

    // Example 1.2
    a <- "a"
    b <- "b"
    c <- "c"

    print(a + "\n")
    print(b + "\n")
    print(c + "\n")

    print("----------\n")

    a <- b
    b <- c 
    c <- "Lady Gaga"

    print(a + "\n")
    print(b + "\n")
    print(c + "\n")

First off we create three global variables called `a`, `b` and `c`. They're the shiz. Each of these variables contains a string* that represents they letter they're supposed to represent. Then we print each of them out, and by using the `+` operator, we add a `\n` to the end of the strings we're printing. 

<sup>*Don't stress out over strings yet. We'll get to them in a sec.</sup>

After a rather plain line separator, we decide it's time to mess with the first three letters of the alphabet, and so our ABCs now become our BCLady Gagas. Again, we print and we're done.

Oh, and one last thing might as well mention here is the concept of statements and semicolons. There are two ways of ending any statement. When I say statement, I mean things like making variables, and loops and conditionals (which we'll look at in a minute. Patience, young grasshopper.) The first way is to simple put each statment on it's own line. When this method is used the newline character at the end of it's line is automatically marked like a statement ender. The other way is to just put a semicolon at the end of the line, which is useful if you have multiple statements on one line. Just so we're clear, here's a few examples of different types of writing the same statment:

    // Example 1.3

    // Normally statements can be written just like this. Since the newline at the
    // end makes Squirrel think the statment is over, you can't really write 
    // statements over more than one line.
    x <- 55

    // Or we can use just a semicolon.
    x <- 55;

    // Two for the price of one, grandma!
    x <- 55; x <-55

In general, I find it cleaner to not use the semicolon at the end. If you ever want me to read your code, you'd be wise and follow in my footsteps.

Alrighty then. At this point I feel that the concept of global variables should be a piece of cake for you. Now, let's introduce the concept of `local` variables.

But, of course, before I can do that, I need to introduce blocks. This is, again, a concept we'll study more in-depth quite shortly, but for now a half-witted, concise, less than true, and not very useful explanation is in order.

Basically a block is a statement that groups other statements together. It starts with a `{` and ends with a `}`. Any statements inside of the two is considered part of the block, and the entire block can be used anywhere any other statement could.

Now, blocks also introduce the concept of scope. Basically it means what happens in <s>Vegas</s> the block stay in the block; well at least some of it. 

I think the best way to visualize this, and introduce `local` variables is through a less than real world example. Consider this problem. You want to create a variable that's equal to two funny words. Let's say _flubber_ and _buttocks_. And for some reason, you need each word to be it's own variable, and the combination variable will be built from the other two with the `+` operator. 

Obviously, you could just create two variables, `flubber`, and `buttocks`, and then combine them into a new variable `funnyword`. The problem is that we only care about the final result, and not the way we got there. If we did it this way, we'd have two extra variables that would mess up Li'l Johhny is misspells `rubber`. That's just not right!

Rather we want a way of achieving the final result, but by making the process of getting there more private. Well here's one way of doing it. 

    // Example 1.4
    
    {
      local flubber  = "flubber"
      local buttocks = "buttocks"
      
      funnyword <- flubber + buttocks
    }
    
    print(funnyword + "\n")

##He's not your `type`
