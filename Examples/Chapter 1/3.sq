// Example 1.3

// Normally statements can be written just like this. Since the newline at the
// end makes Squirrel think the statment is over, you can't really write 
// statements over more than one line.
x <- 55

// Or we can use just a semicolon.
x <- 55;

// Two for the price of one, grandma!
x <- 55; x <-55
