#Preface

I'm not going to lie to you. I'm writing this tutorial about learning Squirrel programming as I'm learning it myself. Now, I totally agree with the statement "<i>No one can learn and teach at the same time.</i>" Luckily, I already know Lua and Javascript (among many others), and so Squirrel isn't _totally_ new, although I'm sure it will at some point introduce a different perspective of something.

It all started a few days ago I realized that I needed to learn Squirrel because it was the main scripting language of an application I'd like to work with. Usually the reference manuals of most programming languages are terse, but manageable, so I looked there first; boy was I wrong. It was more like a language specification, and when it's 12:45 A.M, that's not what you want!

My next (and honestly final) hope was my best friend, Google. If he couldn't help me, no one could. Guess what? He couldn't help me. 

It was at that point that I realized that all I was asking for was a short, simple, straight-forward tutorial that I could skim over to get the syntax down and perhaps a few best practices too. Was that really so much? Apparently it was.

After I settled down with a relaxing 10 hour Nyan Cat session, I realized that Squirrel was new in town. It needed some help getting off it's feet, and I was the just the guy <s>with super powers</s> for the job. Thus _this_ was born. 

In all seriousness though, I hope this really helps someone out. Squirrel looks like a really awesome language, it just freakin' tutorial, that's all.
